## Liquid-handling robot protocols

The mRNA extraction and TM3'seq protocols were optimized to work on 96-well plates, and therefore they can be used as reference to develop protocols for liquid-handling platforms. 

We have implemented both protocols in CyBioÂ® FeliX pipetting robot (Analitik Jena). The main protocols, subroutines, and set-up files for this specific liquid-handling platform are available under request. Please contact the authors:
